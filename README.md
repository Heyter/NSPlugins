## Safebox Plugin

This plugin allows players to have a safe place to store their items. No one except the player can access this safe inventories, as the data is stored in the character. This also allows to use only one entity that every character can use at the same time, as it will not
interfere with other inventories that are opened at the same time.

## Looting Plugin

This plugin will make a player drop all its inventory in the form of a bag when they die, so that they can be 'looted'. However, this will
not make the player drop the money they have.
